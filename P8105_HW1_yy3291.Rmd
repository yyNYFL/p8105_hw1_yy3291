```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(moderndive)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## This chunk of code loads the early_january_weather data set and describes it
##I first used the view function within tibble to view in a separate window all of the 15 variables and 358 observations contained in the dataset. It allows me to see all the variable names and observation: origin(EWR), year(2013), month(01), day(01), hour, temp, dewp, humid, wind_dir, wind_speed, wind_gust, precip, pressure, visib, time_hour,
```{r}
data("early_january_weather")
view(early_january_weather)
```

## This chunk of code looks at some important values of some of the variables 
```{r}

```


This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
